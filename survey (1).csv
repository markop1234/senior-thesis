I am happy that they are trying as I see more “tugs” (the engines we use to tow packages) that are electric and must be charged to operate. However it’s not always easy to use them 24/7 like the gas tugs because they have to charge and can’t be used by some of the shifts, so the only solution  for my company is to buy a lot more tugs so production doesn’t stop. When some are charging. That’s going to be more expensive than to just keep putting gas in regular tugs.","We have audits and training each year that’s mandatory and we learn about company policies and such to be inclusive and safe. There’s not much a barrier there since I live in Southern California, where we are already very diverse. I think the worst barrier for us would be to have more gender inclusivity for women since this is a male dominated job. The only reason is male dominated, is because of the labor that you have to do, which is strenuous Such as loading trailers and many women don’t want to do that, so it’s not really the companies fault. Also they encourage us to donate to United Way through our paychecks as well.","I think the biggest barrier for governmental pillar behaviors is that our company is so big and has so many employees. It really is hard to be able to see how decisions are made for the higher-ups and and what they make since they rarely are even seen walking in our hubs. due to us being a union job I do feel that there is some protection for us employees, however when I think of shareholders and board members I have no idea what decisions they’re making unless I really look for it so I don’t think it would be way for regular people to see any corruption. I don’t know if our board is even diverse. So the biggest problem is there’s just too many employees in the company is too big for this pillar to be
